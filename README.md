Ask Anything About GITAM
An AI-Powered University Information Chatbot
Ask Anything About GITAM is an intelligent AI-powered chatbot designed to answer any question related to GITAM Deemed University. The system provides instant, accurate, and verified information about courses, fee structures, admissions, academics, grading policies, and campus life.
This project aims to simplify access to university information for students, parents, and faculty by enabling natural, conversational interaction instead of manual website searching.
In modern educational institutions, students and parents often struggle to find accurate and updated information due to scattered webpages and complex portals.Our solution addresses this problem by building a centralized AI assistant that delivers verified responses instantly.
The chatbot uses Artificial Intelligence and automation workflows to understand user queries, retrieve real-time data from official GITAM sources, and present it in a user-friendly conversational format.
